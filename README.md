## Tech

* HTML5: The latest HyperText Markup Language (HTML5) to structure the content of our application. HTML5 introduces more descriptive and semantic tags, ensuring content is both easily readable by developers and efficiently parsed by search engines.

* Bootstrap v5: The latest version of Bootstrap was used to structure the content's layout and styling. It was an essential tool for creating a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing UI.

* CSS3: Utilized Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3) to enhance the visual design of the application. CSS was instrumental in tailoring our pages to align with the aesthetics and themes of our application, as well as in customizing icons and buttons.

* Javascript: At the core of our game's interactivity lies JavaScript. This powerful scripting language not only brought to life dynamic game features like generating clues and randomizing selections but also facilitated user interactions. It enabled users to actively make their picks, receive instantaneous feedback, and immerse themselves in a responsive gaming experience. From the gameboard's intricate functionalities to the simplest user prompts, JavaScript was the driving force behind them all.

* Fontawesome: The icons elegantly displayed across our website owe their aesthetic appeal to FontAwesome. This versatile icon toolkit provided us with a vast array of high-quality icons, enhancing the visual experience and ensuring a consistent visual language throughout the platform.

* Google Images: Many of the captivating visuals on our website, including the background images, room thumbnails, and the striking backdrop for our homepage's introduction, were sourced from Google Images. These selections played a pivotal role in setting the right ambiance and enriching the overall user experience on our platform.

* Chatgpt: A significant portion of our story introductions, characters, and narratives were conceived with the assistance of ChatGPT. This advanced AI system not only enriched our content with creative flair but also served as a valuable tool for debugging and consultation throughout our development process. Relying on ChatGPT ensured that our narratives were fresh, engaging, and tailored to our game's objectives.
